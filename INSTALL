Installation
------------

The newest source code is available from
link:http://people.redhat.com/laroche/pyrpm/[].
We will setup a more permanent project place, mailinglist and wiki later on.

The easiest way to install PyRPM is by compiling the src.rpm and installing
that. Python 2.3 or newer is required. In addition to standard python modules
PyRPM depends on:

 - libxml2-python to read xml files like the repo data from yum. Available from
   link:http://xmlsoft.org/[].
 - pysqlite (which is installed as python-sqlite on Fedora Core) and sqlite
   from link:http://pysqlite.org/[] and link:http://sqlite.org/[]
 - urlgrabber to download files via http and ftp
   from link:http://linux.duke.edu/projects/urlgrabber/[]

All the above are part of the Fedora Core 4 or newer, you might have to add
them yourself to older releases.
