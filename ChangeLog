	* pyrpm/orderer.py 1.17, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.54, pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.35:
	[tw] - RpmList and RpmResolver are not bound to a specific operation anymore,
	  RpmOrderer is a two stage process now:

	- New functions RpmList::install, RpmList::update, RpmList::freshen and
	  RpmList::erase functions, removed old RpmList::append
	- RpmList::appended split up in two lists:
	  - RpmList::installs and RpmList::erases
	    installs contains all packages wich are added to the list, erases all
	    packages, which are removed. This includes updated and obsoleted
	    packages.
	- RpmResolver::updates moved to RpmList, also all functionality for this
	  list
	- Added semi-private function RpmList::_install, which has a no_check tag
	  to make it possible to add all packages from the installed tree.
	- New RpmList::__contains__ function to check if a package is in the list
	- New functions for inheritance of updates and obsoletes:
	  RpmList::_inheritUpdates and RpmResolver::_inheritObsoletes
	- Droppend old RpmResolver::erased list
	- Renamed RpmResolver::_update to RpmResolver::update and RpmResolver::_erase
	  to RpmResolver::erase
	- Dropped unneeded RpmResolver::_pkgErase
	- Dropped already deprecated RpmResolver::doObsoletes
	- The constructor of RpmOrderer now gets the installs, updates, obsoletes and
	  erases lists from a RpmResolver and no operation anymore:
	  All packages in installs are getting installed or updated, if the package
	  is a key in updates or obsoletes
	- RpmOrderer::genRelations now needs a list of packages and an operation
	- New function RpmOrderer::_genEraseOps, the code was the same twice in
	  RpmOrderer::genOperations
	- RpmOrderer::orderRpms renamed to RpmOrderer::_genOrder:
	- New function RpmOrderer::genOrder, which calls RpmOrderer::_genOrder for
	  the installs and then for the erases. The ordering of the operations is
	  slightly different now:
	  The installs and updates are sorted like they were. The erases are ordered
	  and reversely appended to this list to make sure that the chance of a#
	  breakage is small while doing these operations.

2005-04-11  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	- Removed respklist from __runDepResolution() and replaced it with a flag
	- Fixed package selection if no packges were added or found for a single dep
	  or for all deps.

	- Reenable filterArchCompat(), we still need that
	- Run filterArchCompat() on repo packges

2005-04-05  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.47, pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.25: [tw]

	- Extended RpmFileInfo to have a getHardLinkID() method. Used in RpmPackage
	  for hardlink detection during install
	- Converted the last few print commands i found to corresponding printFOO()
	  calls
	- Changed behaviour of installFile() and read() in RpmIO for the cpio archive
	  to return filename, cpio and filesize instead of the whole data. Makes
	  installing large files a lot snappier and takes way less memory
	- Set file mods for device files, too
	- Dropped some debug print calls
	- Extended CPIOFile to behave a little like a filedescriptor so we can use it
	  in installFile()
	- Do automatic padding in getNextEntry() in CPIOFile
	- Finally remove gzip reference, the new PyGZIP is already much better and
	  faster
	- Moved a lot of the functional code of pyrpmyum in an own class in yum.py
	  so we can use it elsewhere externally

2005-04-04  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.46: [tw]
	- replay obsoletes and updates on package erase

	  parent process after child exits to update the internal DB)
	- Some code cleanup in RpmController::run()
	- Added parseBoolean() function in functions (needed for comps.xml parsing)
	- Fixed the normalizeRegex() function to escape all special chars now

	- Extended and fixed pyrpmyum to now have a very similar cli to the
	  original yum
	- Extended pyrpmyum to support groupinstalls via a comps.xml file
	- Don't exit if a package can't be found during package search in pyrpmyum

	- Marked the filecolor section in __verifyInstallFile() which needs to be
	  implemented correctly for multilib
	- Switched key type for hardlink hash from strings to integers
	- Together with Thomas fixed a bug in the resolver where a packages would get
	  added multiple times

	  be updated because of an update of a given package on the command line
	- Rewrote the package selection in pyrpmyum to use the new findPkgByName()
	  function

	* FILES 1.2, README 1.5, TODO 1.10, pyrpm/config.py 1.4, pyrpm/control.py 1.11, pyrpm/io.py 1.10, pyrpm/package.py 1.13, test7 1.3:
	- Updated FILES documentation
	- Minor updates to README, needs more TLC
	- Put some todos in TODO
	- test7 now reads everything (including cpio archive if available)
	- Extended RpmConfig to contain os.uname() information
	- Implemented Triggers class for trigger lookups. Based on Provides from Thomas
	- Readded buildroot to RpmController as we need it for chroots again
	- Completely implemented Triggersupport in RpmController
	- Do blockforks during install. Speeds up install by a factor of 2
	- Read headers twice. Once for RpmResolver with limited headers, second time for
	  install with every header
	- Dropped os.uname() call from RpmController, use rpmconfig
	- Fixed RpmDB class to finally manage to read in /var/lib/rpm so that the saved
	  headers can be reread by rpm again
	- Corrected the args for the runScript() calls to really reflect the # of
	  packages (source and target)
	- Fixed a small problem of RpmUserCache class with not found uid/gids
	- Don't close an RpmPackage after read() anymore
	- Make generateFilenames() public again in RpmPackage class
	- Correctly implement hash marks during install
	- If we have "oldfilenames" use them, otherwise use basename/dirname combo
	- Add getEVR() method to RpmPackage
	- Rewrote getDeps() in RpmPackage and change all methods that rely on it

2005-03-02  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/cpio.py 1.5: - cleanup

2005-03-02  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.7: - Added noarch for buildarchtranslate

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.10, pyrpm/cpio.py 1.4, pyrpm/functions.py 1.10, pyrpm/io.py 1.9, pyrpm/package.py 1.12, pyrpmdb2rpmdb 1.1, test10 1.2, test7 1.2, test9 1.2:
	- Added pyrpmdb2rpmdb tool to convert our database to a rpm database
	- Modified test9 install testapp to support profiling
	- Use RpmResolver operation definitions for operations
	- Finished the freshenPkgs() method in RpmController to select and filter the
	  right packages
	- Delete unused variables, especially larger ones (large lists etc)
	- Remove duplicate operations from operations list. Might happen due to updates
	  and concurrent obsoletes
	- Some more code cleanup in RpmController
	- For updates always select the newest package given
	- Massively clean up the CPIO class and remove unused code
	- Fix runScript() to behave exactly like rpm
	- Set file mods on already installed directories, too (like rpm does)
	- Use os.lchown() for symlinks, otherwise the targe will be chowned :)
	- Fix my pkgCompare() functions to convert epochs always to strings
	- Dropped the skipsig parameter in the RpmStreamIO classes
	- Added an optional parameter to read() for RpmStreamIO to skip the parsing of
	  the complete header and move directly to the cpio archive
	- Optimized the generateTag() method, one of our most time consuming methods
	- Implemented the RpmDB class very similar to our RpmPyDB class
	- Dropped the "filenames" from RpmPyDB as we can generate that list faster
	  internally and saving it takes ages
	- Implemented the RpmUserCache class and use it per package for installation,
	  safes about 10 Minutes for a complete FC3 install
	- Modified RpmPackage to actually only read a rpm header once and otherwise
	  always skip parsing it
	- If a post script fails we don't abort the operation anymore just print the
	  error message as all files have already been written/erased anyway
	- Drop some unecessary time consuming method calls in RpmPackage
	- First rough version of the '#' markers during operation
	- Fixed a bug in the verfifyInstallFile() method in RpmPackage where an config
	  file update wasn't detected properly

2005-02-25  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.13: [tw]
	- checkDependencies: do not check installed packages if no packages are getting
	  removed by erase or obsolete

2005-02-24  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/hashlist.py 1.2, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.12:
	[tw] - removed double inversion of obsoletes in _genOperations

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.11: [tw]
	- made instlist permanent in RpmResolver, generation in __init__
	  this simplifies the whole structure and functions
	- do not check dependencies and conflicts for already installed packages
	- use self.operation flag in the whole class
	- generate todo list in genRelations, it is only needed there
	- removed _genInstList function
	- simplified ordering of obsoletes in _genOperations

	- renamed _gen_operator to _genOperator, _gen_depstr to _genDepString,
	  genInstList to _genInstList, genOperations to _genOperations
	- integrated no_relations in relations: _Relations class supports now supports
	  empty relations
	- minimal multilib support in checkPkgDependencies
	- separated checkConflicts and checkFileConflicts
	- loop detection starts with a better node (minimal pre nodes), searches for
	  smaller loops

2005-02-24  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.6:
	- Added buildarchtranslet table for mutlilib handling

2005-02-22  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.9:
	[tw] ignore unresolved in genRelations, we are only looking at the changes,
	  therefore not all symbols are resolvable in these changes
	(note for me: keep it simple)

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.8: [tw]
	 - rewritten normalize function, dropped string compare of headers: speedup
	 - new functions for operationFlag, genInstList, genOperations, detectLoop and
	   breakupLoop for better code structure
	 - resolve: install in todo list (old: update)
	 - moved no_relations out of genOrder

	- Added my various other testscripts. Not all of the work properly all the
	  time, so use at own risk. :)
	- Ran pychecker on complete code and fixed the real bugs found by it (has some
	  false positives)
	- Removed various debug output print statements
	- RpmPyDB now really reads the whole DB when read() is called. Prevents problems
	  when doing checks agains the DB in child processes
	- Dropped tag paramenter from internal __generateTag() method in io.py
	- Updated the DB for addPkg() and erasePkg() calls in memory, too
	- Added isSourceRPM() in RpmPackage (from Karel Zak)
	- Implemented %config(noreplace) checks for package updates

2005-02-21  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.7:
	[tw] moved "Checking dependencies for" back to checkDependencies

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.6: [tw]
	- new function checkPkgDependencies to check dependencies for one package
	  against install list
	- use this new function in checkDependencies and in genRelations
	- search for leaf node with the highest requirement instead of using the
	  first one
	- moved OP_INSTALL, OP_UPDATE, UP_ERASE up in RpmResolver class
	- be more verbose in debug mode

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.5: [tw] add files only once to multi in _Filenames

2005-02-21  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* TODO 1.9: ++

	* TODO 1.8: - ++

	* TODO 1.6: - commit

2005-02-17  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.5, pyrpm/control.py 1.8, pyrpm/io.py 1.7, pyrpm/package.py 1.10:
	- Extended the RpmFileInfo to contain the file attribute flags
	- Added the File verify flags to base.py (need to add the verifyflags to
	  RpmFileInfo, too)
	- Revamped the handling of package updates: Insert erase operations for all
	  updated packages after the update operation for the new one
	- Added a isDuplicate(file) method to the DB class (needed during erase
	  operation)
	- Added some temporary debug output during file install and removal
	- Handle duplicate files during removal
	- During package erase if scripts fail simply print out an error message
	  instead of aborting the whole operation

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.7, pyrpm/io.py 1.6, pyrpm/package.py 1.9:
	- Some more code control flow rearrangements
	- More data and method hiding

	* TODO 1.5, pyrpm/control.py 1.6, pyrpm/package.py 1.8:
	- Removed debug output in erasePkg() method
	- Started hiding internal only methods

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.4, pyrpm/config.py 1.3, pyrpm/control.py 1.5, pyrpm/functions.py 1.7, pyrpm/io.py 1.5, pyrpm/package.py 1.7:
	- Added RPM file attributes to base.py for use in install/erase methods
	- Fixed missing warning_level in RpmConfig init
	- Removed setDB() call from controller, was really pointless
	- readDB() in controller now takes a db as argument, '/var/lib/pyrpm' is default
	  if none given
	- Fixed the erasePkgs() method to report if no packages were removed
	- Rearranged the whole RpmController code to reflect control flow better
	- Dropped addRepo() and addAvailable() from controller, will be done in a
	  separate class anyway
	- erasePkg() now checks the strings given correctly and searches the installed
	  packages for possible matches very similar to how rpm does it
	- Added findUpdatePkgs() which looks for packages that will be replaced by
	  an update operation. Fails if newer or same packages are found, otherwise
	  stores all found packages in a spezial hash list
	- run() now correctly handles updates where the new package is first installed
	  and then all related old packages get removed afterwards
	- Fixed printInfo and printWarning functions to actually use the corresponding
	  level variable in RpmConfig ;)
	- Added envraSplit() function which tries to extract the epoch, name, version,
	  release and arch from a given package string as correctly as possible
	- Extended RpmData class to behave like a real hash with necessary methods
	- Switched to use and treat RpmData classes like a hash outside now (no more
	  direct internal access to data necessary)
	- Dropped files parameter from install and erase and replaced it with a DB
	  parameter (which makes a lot more sense)
	- Fixed a few output and message calls
	- Disabled return code checks for preun and postun for now as bash needs
	  /bin/sh in postun (which is really really stupid as it has just been
	  deleted...)

2005-02-11  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.3, pyrpm/control.py 1.4, pyrpm/functions.py 1.6, pyrpm/io.py 1.4, pyrpm/package.py 1.6, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.5:
	- Forgot to add noarch to rpm lead headers, fixed.
	- Initialized interal pydb in RpmController

	- Check function for older or same installs of packages
	- Extended preprocess in RpmController to use install check for install
	- Moved complete DB handling to parent process. Uses exit code of childs
	- Removed level from printError again (doesn't make sense)
	- Fixed the printInfo and printWarning functions to use the level
	- Added pkgCompare function to EVR compare 2 RpmPackages
	- Changed parsesig to skipsig, we generally have to read the signature
	- Full implementation of RpmPyDB. Allows adding and erasing of packages and
	  handles everything
	- Extended getRpmIOFactory() for RpmPyDBIO objects
	- Renamed remove() method in RpmPackage to erase()
	- Fixed return code of erase() method
	- Fixed small bug in resolver.py with wrong number of arguments

	[tw] renamed RpmList::search_dep to RpmList::searchDependency

	* classes.fig 1.2: [tw] added RpmResolver, RpmList and HashList

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.2:
	[tw] fix from Karel Zak: package obsoletes the package itself or an older
	  package with the same name

2005-02-11  Karel Zak  <kzak@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/package.py 1.4:
	RpmPackage.getNEVRA() called self.NEVR() but there is self.getNVER() only

2005-02-10  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.2: [tw] removed verbose variable

	* rpmresolve.py 1.1: [tw] test script for RpmResolver

	[tw] integrated resolver
	 - hashlist
	 - rpmlist
	 - resolver

2005-02-10  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/package.py 1.3, pyrpm/functions.py 1.2:
	- Added patch from Karel Zak to allow installations of SRPMS, too.
	- Better way of detecting SRPMS done by Karel Zak. Need to verify if that works
	  for all srpms and rpms out there.

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.2, pyrpm/io.py 1.2, pyrpm/package.py 1.2, pyrpm/base.py 1.2:
	- Added arch_compat hash to be used for machine distance (see rpm sourcecode ;)
	- Need to import config in base (for later debug/info output)
	- Moved binary MAGIC tags into base for reuse
	- Added rpm_lead_arch, used in lead to identify arch via file(1)
	- Wrote first version of controler and used it in 1 testscript. Now only 2
	  lines of code need to be written to install/update/erase a set of rpms :)
	- All RpmIOs now know their source (self.source)
	- Initialized the cpiofd and cpio variables in RpmStreamIO
	- Close the cpiofd and cpio variables in close() of RpmStreamIO
	- Fixed bug in the signature streaming (no more rpmconstants)
	- Used the new MAGIC tags in lead and index code in RpmStreamIO
	- Wrote rpm binary header writer. Rpm is able to read and display the produced
	  file without a problem, so seems to work. ;)
	- Changed interface to open() in RpmIO to allow opening for write. Default is
	  still read only.
	- Allow use of tags and ntags in RpmPackage::install()
	- Signature data is now stored in pkg["signature"] hash
	- Added getNEVR() method to RpmPackage (needed for controller)

2005-02-08  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* rpmresolve 1.2: [tw]
	 - support for installed tree
	 - support for repo
	 - new package obsoletes installed package
	 - RpmList contains provides and filenames: adding a rpm to the list adds
	   provides to list.provides and filenames to list.filenames, remove ..

2005-02-07  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* rpmresolve 1.1: [tw] rpmresolve
	 - resolves provides
	 - checks for conflicts
	 - checks for file conflicts
	 - orderes package list using relations

	* hashlist.py 1.1: [tw] hashlist
	 - using hashes for quick searches and lists for simple access

2005-02-07  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* cpio.py 1.17, pyrpm/.cvsignore 1.1, pyrpm/__init__.py 1.1, pyrpm/base.py 1.1, pyrpm/config.py 1.1, pyrpm/control.py 1.1, pyrpm/cpio.py 1.1, pyrpm/functions.py 1.1, pyrpm/io.py 1.1, pyrpm/package.py 1.1, pyrpmlib.py 1.24, rpmconstants.py 1.12, test 1.2, test2 1.6, test3 1.5, test4 1.2, test5 1.3, test6 1.2, ugid.py 1.3:

	* pyrpmlib.py 1.22, rpmconstants.py 1.11, test2 1.5, test3 1.4, test5 1.2:
	- Fixed bug in header reading, sig and header are 2 separately handled "entities"
	- Extended all IO classes to use the "default" contructor arguments.
	- Make sure RpmPackage knows when it has already read the header
	- Fixed bug where tags and ntags weren't used correctly
	- Dropped io argument from readHeader() and extract() in RpmPackage, it already
	  has an io. If not, then we need to error out anyway.
	- Extended readHeader to support tags and ntags (like RpmFileIO did in the past)
	- Added first cut of remove() method in RpmPackage to remove a package (simple
	  version for now).
	- Fixed small bug in hardlink handling where the dirs wouldn't be automatically
	  created.
	- Reworked the getpwnam and getgrnam stuff as they exit the client if
	  /etc/passwd and/or /etc/group isn't there. :(
	- Switched to using fork()/execv() in runScript() just as rpm does. Works much
	  more reliabled now and doesn't need /bin/sh anymore ;)
	- Small fifo creation fix
	- Added the whole RPMSENSEFLAGS stuff from rpmlib.h as we need that to handle
	  dependancies correctly and "evaluate" them.
	- Minor fixes to test scripts.

2005-02-04  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm.py 1.32, pyrpmlib.py 1.21, rpmconstants.py 1.10: - sync

	- Fixed leaking fd in RpmFileIO class
	- Extended the getRpmIOFactory() function to take the additional parameters
	  for the IO classes and use them for object creation
	- Dropped tags and ntags now from the RpmPackage constructor, too and moved
	  those params to the read method. Default is still all tags.
	- Extended RpmPackage to now provide a open() and close() method. Used
	  internally as well. Needed for installation (chroot problem)
	- Fixed the testscripts to use new interface for RpmPackage and RpmIO

	* pyrpmlib.py 1.19: - Added rpmIOFactory()
	- Started changes for read()/write() code for RpmPackage and where the ios come
	  from (the factory, of course ;).

2005-02-01  Phil Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpmlib.py 1.18: - Use of mkstemp instead of mktemp
