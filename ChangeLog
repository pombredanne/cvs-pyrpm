	* pyrpm/comps.py 1.5, pyrpm/database/repodb.py 1.13, pyrpm/package.py 1.115, pyrpm/yum.py 1.106:
	- Added a compstype attribute to RpmPackage in which the "highest" type for
	  yumrepo packages is stored in case a comps.xml is available
	- Read the comps.xml at the right place in repodb
	- Extended our comps class to allow queries for types of package names
	- RpmYum.__handleUpdatePkglist() now honors the comps type of packages if
	  available and tries to use highest priority packages first

	* pyrpm/config.py 1.55, pyrpm/database/repodb.py 1.12, pyrpm/functions.py 1.169, pyrpm/yum.py 1.105:
	- Fixed bug in getFreeCacheSpace() where for buildroots we could end up in an
	  infinite loop.
	- Removed compsfile from our config class and made the comps object a use case
	  in our repodb classes so each repo can now have a comps object (if a
	  comps.xml file is available).

2006-03-22  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* doc/pyrpm.txt 1.7:
	- Find out how todo linebreaks with asciidoc and only do one
	  level of enumerations.

2006-03-22  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/database/sqlitedb.py 1.6, pyrpm/disk.py 1.11, pyrpm/functions.py 1.168, pyrpm.spec.in 1.16:
	- Make sqlite and pyparted optional. Only i case they actually get used
	  we now raise an ImportError.
	- Improved and fixed some bugs in the calcFreeDiskspace() function. Now works
	  correctly, also for changeroots and for updates the necessary size is much
	  closer to reality (as opposed to before).

2006-03-20  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.85, pyrpm/database/repodb.py 1.11, pyrpm/package.py 1.114, pyrpm/yum.py 1.104:
	- Don't use the dict of packages to store yumrepo in packages, use a class
	  variable (to separate the header info from "meta" info properly)
	- Additionally store the original href in a package if it comes from a yum
	  repository. Needed for cache clearing after successfull installation
	- After a successfull installation remove all packages that were installed
	  from the cache.
	- Some minor typo fixes
	- Treat update and upgrade the same way in respect to install_only packages,
	  just like yum.

2005-12-02  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am 1.17, doc/pyrpm.txt 1.4: - reorg the docu place

2005-12-02  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/config.py 1.47, pyrpm/control.py 1.75, pyrpm/functions.py 1.148, pyrpm/io.py 1.114, pyrpm/package.py 1.102, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.94, pyrpm/yum.py 1.80, tests/test 1.19, tests/test8 1.3:
	- Included 2 new undocumented options (for now) to pyrpmyum:
	  o --resolvesrpm     Resolves all buildrequires if you install srpms and
	                      installes the required packages
	  o --srpmdir         Directory where the source rpm files will be written to.
	                      Default is /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
	- Removed all cruft where we missused the buildroot as target directory for
	  srpms.
	- Implemented a bsearch() function that works identical to the glibc one. Needed
	  for converting oldfilenames to basenames/dirnames/dirindexes exactly like rpm.
	- Need to generate basenames/dirnames/dirindexes for old rpm 3.x headers if we
	  want to store them in the rpmdb. Make sure we generate the lists exactly
	  like rpm (as there is a bug in rpm we have to "simulate").
	- Rpm 3.x headers didn't have a self provide. Add it to the header if it's
	  missing for those rpms, just like rpm does.
	- Don't create some unecessary lists for repo and rpmdb resolvers anymore.
	- Use the config.srpmdir for installing srpm files properly.
	- Fixed some text messages
	- Don't remove the requires from srpms if the --resolvesrpm has been used.
	- Don't want confirmation for --test runs (kinda silly to ask that ;)
	- Some changes to my testscripts to verify the latest changes.

2005-11-29  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/yum.py 1.79:
	- Fixed several sys.exit() calls at the wrong places.
	- RpmYum::addRepo() now returns 1 on success, as expected.

	* pyrpm/yum.py 1.78, pyrpm/functions.py 1.147:
	- Fixed run_main() to not do the sys.exit() itself but leave it up to the
	  calling script to handle the failure
	- Reworked the dependency loop once more, this time hopefully fixed for good.
	  Ran some tests with it that all ended correctly.
	- Fixed a little code documentation.

2005-11-29  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* scripts/pyrpmkickstart 1.33: [tw]
	- enabled upgrade via kickstart

	- Added --installroot= option to yum for compatibility
	- Removed some old unused commented out code.
	- Added support for mirrorlist and baseurls from yum.conf
	- Added some more useful printInfo and timing output to see what/where the code
	  is at the moment.
	- Fixed a bug in RpmYum::__generateObsoletesList() where too many packages were
	  added to the list. Speeds things up for 1st and 2nd phase of obsolete handling

	* pyrpm/yum.py 1.76:

	  deps couldn't be resolved properly.
	- Fixed small bug in pyrpmrandomizer where the FakeRepo would still get added
	  even if it had 0 packages in it (which caused the package selector later to
	  traceback).

2005-11-17  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* scripts/oldpyrpm.py 1.137: - remove archDuplicate(), never used
	- remove archCompat() as machineDistance() is giving the
	  same information
	- move setting rpm.mdistance into upper functions to
	  selectNewestRpms(), this is a bad hack

2005-11-17  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/orderer.py 1.37: [tw]
	[tw]
	- added RpmRelations::orderIterationFunc and RpmRelations::orderLoopFunc to get

	  repo <name> --url=nfs://<server><path>
	  repo <name> --url=file://<path>
	  where <path> is a full qualified path name with a leading "/"
	- initialize disk if there is no disklabel

	- moved exclude in yum.conf to the main section
	- add repos to yum.conf

	* pyrpm/kickstart.py 1.11: [tw]
	- added repo support:

	  repo <name> --url=file://<path>

	  where <path> is a full qualified path name with a leading "/"

2005-11-17  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* scripts/oldpyrpm.py 1.136:
	- only output stats for repos if we actually read them

	* scripts/oldpyrpm.py 1.135:
	- selectNewestRpm(): first sort by arch distance, then by version numbers,
	  so we never go from e.g. a i686 rpm to a i386, even if newer i386 rpms
	  show up
	- RpmTree(), slightly reduce code size
	- RpmRepo: delDebuginfo(): add glibc-debuginfo-common as special case, bad
	- RpmRepo: add delSrc() to remove src.rpm packages
	- readRepos: add option to read/ignore src.rpms
	- readPackages:
	  - option to keep the raw data as well as the data for the parsed headers
	  - option to specify which header tags to read
	- change default to ignore fileconflicts, add option --fileconflicts to
	  enable them again
	- add option --updaterpms to start looking at update algorithm
	- add timing stats and number of rpm package stats to the verify part
	- do not even include src.rpms to check dependencies for trees

	- Tons of documentation updates and restructuring. Needs some more work to have
	  them crosslinked with asciidoc, but that's next.
	- Unified the way our scripts work and their return values. Correct exit(1) is
	  now done in all error cases so bash scripts can check if an error occured.

	* pyrpm/package.py 1.97:
	- Fix for issrc (which gets thrown over board after a close() call).

	- filter out packages not suitable for our arch
	- correctly work also on multilib systems
	- print rpms deleted/ignored during for the checks

	- First implementation of proper and correct filestates for RpmDB
	- Optimized the removeIdx() call in RpmDB

	- Use the linktos information now to create the symlinks. Verification code is
	  still in place to test if the rpm header info differs from the cpio one
	- Use mkstemp_link() to create hardlinks and copy them in case the hardlink
	  fails
	- Implemented 2 functions to block and unblock the common termination signals
	- Fixed a small bug where Miloslav forgot to remove a "/" for os.path.join()
	  which prevented rpmdb read() from working
	- Use the blockSignal() and unblockSignal() functions in addPkg() and erasePkg()
	  methods of RpmDB and RpmPyDB classes
	- In case of write failures to the databases the internal DB will now be
	  consistent with the actual files on disk.
	- Handle failed "commit" statements in the RpmSqLiteDB class correctly
	- Fixed the isEqual() method of RpmPackage to be compatible to rpm behaviour
	  in respect to Epoch (empty epoch is identical to Epoch=0)

	- Implemented the getFreeCachespace() function to determine if we have enough
	  space for the cached rpms for a whole operation
	- Fixed bug where for filemd5 checks "fileflags" was used instead of "filemodes"
	- Fixed Filemd5s database writing to be equal to how rpm does it: Rpm only
	  writes filemd5s entries for files without an empty filemd5s.
	- Used the same logic in pyrpmdbverify for verifying the Filemd5s database
	- Extract some more useful information from primary.xml repo headers. Those
	  packages now also contain the correct pkg["signature"]["size_in_sig"] and
	  the correct range_signature, range_header and range_payload variables.
	- Some needed changes for private test scripts

	* pyrpm/orderer.py 1.17, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.54, pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.35:
	[tw] - RpmList and RpmResolver are not bound to a specific operation anymore,
	  RpmOrderer is a two stage process now:

	- New functions RpmList::install, RpmList::update, RpmList::freshen and
	  RpmList::erase functions, removed old RpmList::append
	- RpmList::appended split up in two lists:
	  - RpmList::installs and RpmList::erases
	    installs contains all packages wich are added to the list, erases all
	    packages, which are removed. This includes updated and obsoleted
	    packages.
	- RpmResolver::updates moved to RpmList, also all functionality for this
	  list
	- Added semi-private function RpmList::_install, which has a no_check tag
	  to make it possible to add all packages from the installed tree.
	- New RpmList::__contains__ function to check if a package is in the list
	- New functions for inheritance of updates and obsoletes:
	  RpmList::_inheritUpdates and RpmResolver::_inheritObsoletes
	- Droppend old RpmResolver::erased list
	- Renamed RpmResolver::_update to RpmResolver::update and RpmResolver::_erase
	  to RpmResolver::erase
	- Dropped unneeded RpmResolver::_pkgErase
	- Dropped already deprecated RpmResolver::doObsoletes
	- The constructor of RpmOrderer now gets the installs, updates, obsoletes and
	  erases lists from a RpmResolver and no operation anymore:
	  All packages in installs are getting installed or updated, if the package
	  is a key in updates or obsoletes
	- RpmOrderer::genRelations now needs a list of packages and an operation
	- New function RpmOrderer::_genEraseOps, the code was the same twice in
	  RpmOrderer::genOperations
	- RpmOrderer::orderRpms renamed to RpmOrderer::_genOrder:
	- New function RpmOrderer::genOrder, which calls RpmOrderer::_genOrder for
	  the installs and then for the erases. The ordering of the operations is
	  slightly different now:
	  The installs and updates are sorted like they were. The erases are ordered
	  and reversely appended to this list to make sure that the chance of a#
	  breakage is small while doing these operations.

	- Need to skip to next file in the cpio archive in RpmPackage:__extract() in
	  case we don't really install a file
	- Fixed a couple of typos and cut&paste errors in yum.py
	- Removed respklist from __runDepResolution() and replaced it with a flag
	- Fixed package selection if no packges were added or found for a single dep
	  or for all deps.
	- Dropped all doObsoletes() calls

2005-04-06  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/functions.py 1.60, pyrpm/config.py 1.20, pyrpm/control.py 1.40:
	- optimize some /sbin/ldconfig calls away by delaying them until the first
	  real script is run. This removes about 140 /sbin/ldconfig calls for a
	  fresh FC3-i386 install.

2005-04-06  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.49: [tw]

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.39, pyrpm/functions.py 1.59, pyrpm/yum.py 1.2:
	- Don't reappend any packages that have been autoerased

	- Simplify RpmController::__preprocess() to only call filterArchCompat()
	- Reenable filterArchCompat(), we still need that
	- Run filterArchCompat() on repo packges

2005-04-05  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.47, pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.25: [tw]

	- Extended RpmFileInfo to have a getHardLinkID() method. Used in RpmPackage
	  for hardlink detection during install
	- Converted the last few print commands i found to corresponding printFOO()
	  calls
	- Changed behaviour of installFile() and read() in RpmIO for the cpio archive
	  to return filename, cpio and filesize instead of the whole data. Makes
	  installing large files a lot snappier and takes way less memory
	- Set file mods for device files, too
	- Dropped some debug print calls
	- Extended CPIOFile to behave a little like a filedescriptor so we can use it
	  in installFile()
	- Do automatic padding in getNextEntry() in CPIOFile
	- Finally remove gzip reference, the new PyGZIP is already much better and
	  faster
	- Moved a lot of the functional code of pyrpmyum in an own class in yum.py
	  so we can use it elsewhere externally

2005-04-04  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.46: [tw]

	- Don't exit if a package can't be found during package search in pyrpmyum

2005-03-18  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/functions.py 1.34: - also remove pkgCompare()

2005-03-17  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* doc/.cvsignore 1.2, scripts/.cvsignore 1.2, .cvsignore 1.5:
	- ignore some more autogenerated files for cvs

	* scripts/pyrpminstall 1.6: - enable timer with "--test" for now

	* pyrpm/functions.py 1.32: - change to evrSplit() was an oversight

	* pyrpm/config.py 1.9, pyrpm/control.py 1.25, pyrpm/functions.py 1.31, pyrpm/hashlist.py 1.7, pyrpm/io.py 1.22, pyrpm/orderer.py 1.7, pyrpm/package.py 1.27, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.29, pyrpm/rpmdist.py 1.4, pyrpm/specfile.py 1.3, scripts/pyrpminstall 1.5:
	- pyrpm/config.py: temporarely add a "timer" config option that does give some
	  additional information about elapsed time for resolver/orderer.
	  Will go away soon again.
	- pyrpm/control.py: check for rpmconfig.test and exit after resolver/orderer
	- pyrpm/{functions.py,io.py,package.py,rpmdist.py,specfile.py):
	  do not import obsolete string functions
	- pyrpm/functions.py: evrString() and allow evrCompare() to take a tuple as
	  first arg

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.24, pyrpm/functions.py 1.30, pyrpm/package.py 1.26, pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.16, scripts/pyrpmyum 1.6:
	- Made # of packages to be installed per fork a variable
	- Fixed setFileMods() behaviour (return values are quite useless, unfortunately)
	- Fixed problem with RpmUserCache class. If no glibc was installed the
	  getpwnam() and getgrnam() calls would fail even if the user/group was in the
	  corresponding /etc files
	- Moved __generateFileInfoList() and __generateHardLinkList() back to
	  __extract(), the pre-Scrip needs to be run bevor generating those lists...
	- Got rid of one self.rfilist.has_key(filename) in __extract() (speedup)
	- Marked the filecolor section in __verifyInstallFile() which needs to be
	  implemented correctly for multilib
	- Switched key type for hardlink hash from strings to integers
	- Together with Thomas fixed a bug in the resolver where a packages would get
	  added multiple times

	- Implemented getFreeDiskspace()
	- Fixed bug in envraSplit() functions
	- Set warning level for "pkg was already added" to 1 (much less nosiy)
	- Implemented new version of findPkgByName(), now can do regex, too
	- Moved generation of RpmFileInfo list and HardLink list to install() method
	  from __extract()
	- Dropped some debug print statements
	- Fixed too strict check in resolver which prevented detection of some deps
	- Fixed pyrpmyum for update case where an already installed package needs to
	  be updated because of an update of a given package on the command line
	- Rewrote the package selection in pyrpmyum to use the new findPkgByName()
	  function

2005-03-02  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.7: - Added noarch for buildarchtranslate

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.10, pyrpm/cpio.py 1.4, pyrpm/functions.py 1.10, pyrpm/io.py 1.9, pyrpm/package.py 1.12, pyrpmdb2rpmdb 1.1, test10 1.2, test7 1.2, test9 1.2:
	- Added pyrpmdb2rpmdb tool to convert our database to a rpm database
	- Modified test9 install testapp to support profiling
	- Use RpmResolver operation definitions for operations
	- Finished the freshenPkgs() method in RpmController to select and filter the
	  right packages
	- Delete unused variables, especially larger ones (large lists etc)
	- Remove duplicate operations from operations list. Might happen due to updates
	  and concurrent obsoletes
	- Some more code cleanup in RpmController
	- For updates always select the newest package given
	- Massively clean up the CPIO class and remove unused code
	- Fix runScript() to behave exactly like rpm
	- Set file mods on already installed directories, too (like rpm does)
	- Use os.lchown() for symlinks, otherwise the targe will be chowned :)
	- Fix my pkgCompare() functions to convert epochs always to strings
	- Dropped the skipsig parameter in the RpmStreamIO classes
	- Added an optional parameter to read() for RpmStreamIO to skip the parsing of
	  the complete header and move directly to the cpio archive
	- Optimized the generateTag() method, one of our most time consuming methods
	- Implemented the RpmDB class very similar to our RpmPyDB class
	- Dropped the "filenames" from RpmPyDB as we can generate that list faster
	  internally and saving it takes ages
	- Implemented the RpmUserCache class and use it per package for installation,
	  safes about 10 Minutes for a complete FC3 install
	- Modified RpmPackage to actually only read a rpm header once and otherwise
	  always skip parsing it
	- If a post script fails we don't abort the operation anymore just print the
	  error message as all files have already been written/erased anyway
	- Drop some unecessary time consuming method calls in RpmPackage
	- First rough version of the '#' markers during operation
	- Fixed a bug in the verfifyInstallFile() method in RpmPackage where an config
	  file update wasn't detected properly

2005-02-25  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.13: [tw]
	- checkDependencies: do not check installed packages if no packages are getting
	  removed by erase or obsolete

2005-02-24  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/hashlist.py 1.2, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.12:
	[tw] - removed double inversion of obsoletes in _genOperations

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.11: [tw]
	- made instlist permanent in RpmResolver, generation in __init__
	  this simplifies the whole structure and functions
	- do not check dependencies and conflicts for already installed packages
	- use self.operation flag in the whole class
	- generate todo list in genRelations, it is only needed there
	- removed _genInstList function
	- simplified ordering of obsoletes in _genOperations

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.10: [tw]
	- renamed _gen_operator to _genOperator, _gen_depstr to _genDepString,
	  genInstList to _genInstList, genOperations to _genOperations
	- integrated no_relations in relations: _Relations class supports now supports
	  empty relations
	- minimal multilib support in checkPkgDependencies
	- separated checkConflicts and checkFileConflicts
	- loop detection starts with a better node (minimal pre nodes), searches for
	  smaller loops
	- breakup loop uses a better node for breakage (minimal pre nodes)
	- orderRpms: select leaf node with smallest list of pre relations
	- first steps of documentation

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.8: [tw] going back to old key (pkg["name"])

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.7: [tw] using N.A as key

2005-02-24  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.6:
	- Added buildarchtranslet table for mutlilib handling

2005-02-22  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.9:
	[tw] ignore unresolved in genRelations, we are only looking at the changes,
	  therefore not all symbols are resolvable in these changes
	(note for me: keep it simple)

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.8: [tw]
	 - rewritten normalize function, dropped string compare of headers: speedup
	 - new functions for operationFlag, genInstList, genOperations, detectLoop and
	   breakupLoop for better code structure
	 - resolve: install in todo list (old: update)
	 - moved no_relations out of genOrder

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.6: [tw] - fixed _filenames.multi

2005-02-22  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	- Added my various other testscripts. Not all of the work properly all the
	  time, so use at own risk. :)
	- Ran pychecker on complete code and fixed the real bugs found by it (has some
	  false positives)
	- Removed various debug output print statements
	- RpmPyDB now really reads the whole DB when read() is called. Prevents problems
	  when doing checks agains the DB in child processes
	- Dropped tag paramenter from internal __generateTag() method in io.py
	- Updated the DB for addPkg() and erasePkg() calls in memory, too
	- Added isSourceRPM() in RpmPackage (from Karel Zak)
	- Implemented %config(noreplace) checks for package updates

2005-02-21  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.7:
	[tw] moved "Checking dependencies for" back to checkDependencies

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.6: [tw]
	- new function checkPkgDependencies to check dependencies for one package
	  against install list
	- use this new function in checkDependencies and in genRelations
	- search for leaf node with the highest requirement instead of using the
	  first one
	- moved OP_INSTALL, OP_UPDATE, UP_ERASE up in RpmResolver class
	- be more verbose in debug mode

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.5: [tw] add files only once to multi in _Filenames

2005-02-21  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	* TODO 1.9: ++

	* TODO 1.8: - ++

	* TODO 1.6: - commit

2005-02-17  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.5, pyrpm/control.py 1.8, pyrpm/io.py 1.7, pyrpm/package.py 1.10:
	- Extended the RpmFileInfo to contain the file attribute flags
	- Added the File verify flags to base.py (need to add the verifyflags to
	  RpmFileInfo, too)
	- Revamped the handling of package updates: Insert erase operations for all
	  updated packages after the update operation for the new one
	- Added a isDuplicate(file) method to the DB class (needed during erase
	  operation)
	- Added some temporary debug output during file install and removal
	- Handle duplicate files during removal
	- During package erase if scripts fail simply print out an error message
	  instead of aborting the whole operation

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.7, pyrpm/io.py 1.6, pyrpm/package.py 1.9:
	- Some more code control flow rearrangements
	- More data and method hiding

	* TODO 1.5, pyrpm/control.py 1.6, pyrpm/package.py 1.8:
	- Removed debug output in erasePkg() method
	- Started hiding internal only methods

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.4, pyrpm/config.py 1.3, pyrpm/control.py 1.5, pyrpm/functions.py 1.7, pyrpm/io.py 1.5, pyrpm/package.py 1.7:
	- Added RPM file attributes to base.py for use in install/erase methods
	- Fixed missing warning_level in RpmConfig init
	- Removed setDB() call from controller, was really pointless
	- readDB() in controller now takes a db as argument, '/var/lib/pyrpm' is default
	  if none given
	- Fixed the erasePkgs() method to report if no packages were removed
	- Rearranged the whole RpmController code to reflect control flow better
	- Dropped addRepo() and addAvailable() from controller, will be done in a
	  separate class anyway
	- erasePkg() now checks the strings given correctly and searches the installed
	  packages for possible matches very similar to how rpm does it
	- Added findUpdatePkgs() which looks for packages that will be replaced by
	  an update operation. Fails if newer or same packages are found, otherwise
	  stores all found packages in a spezial hash list
	- run() now correctly handles updates where the new package is first installed
	  and then all related old packages get removed afterwards
	- Fixed printInfo and printWarning functions to actually use the corresponding
	  level variable in RpmConfig ;)
	- Added envraSplit() function which tries to extract the epoch, name, version,
	  release and arch from a given package string as correctly as possible
	- Extended RpmData class to behave like a real hash with necessary methods
	- Switched to use and treat RpmData classes like a hash outside now (no more
	  direct internal access to data necessary)
	- Dropped files parameter from install and erase and replaced it with a DB
	  parameter (which makes a lot more sense)
	- Fixed a few output and message calls
	- Disabled return code checks for preun and postun for now as bash needs
	  /bin/sh in postun (which is really really stupid as it has just been
	  deleted...)

2005-02-11  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/base.py 1.3, pyrpm/control.py 1.4, pyrpm/functions.py 1.6, pyrpm/io.py 1.4, pyrpm/package.py 1.6, pyrpm/resolver.py 1.5:
	- Forgot to add noarch to rpm lead headers, fixed.
	- Initialized interal pydb in RpmController
	- Call setBuildroot() in all operation methods
	- Really read in database of installed files
	- Check function for older or same installs of packages
	- Extended preprocess in RpmController to use install check for install
	- Moved complete DB handling to parent process. Uses exit code of childs
	- Removed level from printError again (doesn't make sense)
	- Fixed the printInfo and printWarning functions to use the level
	- Added pkgCompare function to EVR compare 2 RpmPackages
	- Changed parsesig to skipsig, we generally have to read the signature
	- Full implementation of RpmPyDB. Allows adding and erasing of packages and
	  handles everything
	- Extended getRpmIOFactory() for RpmPyDBIO objects
	- Renamed remove() method in RpmPackage to erase()
	- Fixed return code of erase() method
	- Fixed small bug in resolver.py with wrong number of arguments

2005-02-11  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/functions.py 1.5:

	- Integrated resolver code from Thomas with my backend and frontend code
	- Handle different types of operations in controller
	- First cut of PyDB read/write code
	- Extended printInfo, printWarning and printError with levels (as debug)
	- Fixed missing import string in resolver.py

2005-02-11  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.3, pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.3:
	[tw] renamed RpmList::search_dep to RpmList::searchDependency

	* classes.fig 1.2: [tw] added RpmResolver, RpmList and HashList

	* pyrpm/rpmlist.py 1.2:
	[tw] fix from Karel Zak: package obsoletes the package itself or an older
	  package with the same name

2005-02-11  Karel Zak  <kzak@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/package.py 1.4:
	RpmPackage.getNEVRA() called self.NEVR() but there is self.getNVER() only

2005-02-10  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/resolver.py 1.2: [tw] removed verbose variable

	[tw] integrated resolver
	 - hashlist
	 - rpmlist
	 - resolver

2005-02-10  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* pyrpm/package.py 1.3, pyrpm/functions.py 1.2:
	- Added patch from Karel Zak to allow installations of SRPMS, too.
	- Better way of detecting SRPMS done by Karel Zak. Need to verify if that works
	  for all srpms and rpms out there.

	* pyrpm/control.py 1.2, pyrpm/io.py 1.2, pyrpm/package.py 1.2, pyrpm/base.py 1.2:
	- Added arch_compat hash to be used for machine distance (see rpm sourcecode ;)
	- Need to import config in base (for later debug/info output)
	- Moved binary MAGIC tags into base for reuse
	- Added rpm_lead_arch, used in lead to identify arch via file(1)
	- Wrote first version of controler and used it in 1 testscript. Now only 2
	  lines of code need to be written to install/update/erase a set of rpms :)
	- All RpmIOs now know their source (self.source)
	- Initialized the cpiofd and cpio variables in RpmStreamIO
	- Close the cpiofd and cpio variables in close() of RpmStreamIO
	- Fixed bug in the signature streaming (no more rpmconstants)
	- Used the new MAGIC tags in lead and index code in RpmStreamIO
	- Wrote rpm binary header writer. Rpm is able to read and display the produced
	  file without a problem, so seems to work. ;)
	- Changed interface to open() in RpmIO to allow opening for write. Default is
	  still read only.
	- Allow use of tags and ntags in RpmPackage::install()
	- Signature data is now stored in pkg["signature"] hash
	- Added getNEVR() method to RpmPackage (needed for controller)

2005-02-08  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* rpmresolve 1.2: [tw]
	 - support for installed tree
	 - support for repo
	 - new package obsoletes installed package
	 - RpmList contains provides and filenames: adding a rpm to the list adds
	   provides to list.provides and filenames to list.filenames, remove ..

2005-02-07  Thomas Woerner  <twoerner@redhat.com>

	* rpmresolve 1.1: [tw] rpmresolve
	 - resolves provides
	 - checks for conflicts
	 - checks for file conflicts
	 - orderes package list using relations

	* hashlist.py 1.1: [tw] hashlist
	 - using hashes for quick searches and lists for simple access

2005-02-07  Philip Knirsch  <pknirsch@redhat.com>

	* cpio.py 1.17, pyrpm/.cvsignore 1.1, pyrpm/__init__.py 1.1, pyrpm/base.py 1.1, pyrpm/config.py 1.1, pyrpm/control.py 1.1, pyrpm/cpio.py 1.1, pyrpm/functions.py 1.1, pyrpm/io.py 1.1, pyrpm/package.py 1.1, pyrpmlib.py 1.24, rpmconstants.py 1.12, test 1.2, test2 1.6, test3 1.5, test4 1.2, test5 1.3, test6 1.2, ugid.py 1.3:

	* pyrpmlib.py 1.22, rpmconstants.py 1.11, test2 1.5, test3 1.4, test5 1.2:
	- Fixed bug in header reading, sig and header are 2 separately handled "entities"
	- Extended all IO classes to use the "default" contructor arguments.
	- Make sure RpmPackage knows when it has already read the header
	- Fixed bug where tags and ntags weren't used correctly
	- Dropped io argument from readHeader() and extract() in RpmPackage, it already
	  has an io. If not, then we need to error out anyway.
	- Extended readHeader to support tags and ntags (like RpmFileIO did in the past)
	- Added first cut of remove() method in RpmPackage to remove a package (simple
	  version for now).
	- Fixed small bug in hardlink handling where the dirs wouldn't be automatically
	  created.
	- Reworked the getpwnam and getgrnam stuff as they exit the client if
	  /etc/passwd and/or /etc/group isn't there. :(
	- Switched to using fork()/execv() in runScript() just as rpm does. Works much
	  more reliabled now and doesn't need /bin/sh anymore ;)
	- Small fifo creation fix
	- Added the whole RPMSENSEFLAGS stuff from rpmlib.h as we need that to handle
	  dependancies correctly and "evaluate" them.
	- Minor fixes to test scripts.

2005-02-04  Florian La Roche  <laroche@redhat.com>

	- Fixed leaking fd in RpmFileIO class
	- Extended the getRpmIOFactory() function to take the additional parameters
	  for the IO classes and use them for object creation
	- Dropped tags and ntags now from the RpmPackage constructor, too and moved
	  those params to the read method. Default is still all tags.
	- Extended RpmPackage to now provide a open() and close() method. Used
	  internally as well. Needed for installation (chroot problem)
	- Fixed the testscripts to use new interface for RpmPackage and RpmIO

	* pyrpmlib.py 1.19: - Added rpmIOFactory()
	- Started changes for read()/write() code for RpmPackage and where the ios come
	  from (the factory, of course ;).
