Overview
-------- 

PyRPM is an experimental project to look at rpm package management. It is 
a python module and a collection of scripts that provide similar functionality
as rpm, yum and co. It is written from ground up and is implemented only in
python. It mainly deals with rpm packages, the rpm database `rpmdb` in 
`/var/lib/rpm`, comps.xml files and yum repositories (called repo data).

The reason for this project was to have a codebase with which we can test and
verify rpm, rpmdb and yum itself and experiment with new features and
implementations very quickly. Python is Red Hat's in-house defacto standard,
so using python to do rapid prototyping was only logical.

The code itself is still very small and modular. We're constantly looking
to improve the code, make it more production ready and remove duplicate
functionality. Results from this project back to rpm and co are very important
for us to improve the current available Linux tools and not rush with only
adding another project for this. Next to working on good algorithms and sane
implementations, most code is backed up with verify and testing scripts.


Warning
-------

The PyRPM project is by no means meant to be a full replacement of rpm or yum.
In its current state we feel confident that in general it won't break
anything, but the code isn't production quality yet. 

The check scripts can be safely used as they won't modify anything on your
system, so feel free to use them at your convenience.

We personally have been using the yum replacement very extensively and even
used it to update our own systems, but that's not even remotely a guarantee
that it will work on your machine. It has only been run by a few people until
now.

Using it to set up buildroots on the other hand should be very safe as this
all happens in a very contained environment (sandbox principle). 

Please let us know of any problems you encounter, if possible with some
reproducible testcases so we can figure out what might have happend.
