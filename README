PyRPM is an experimental project to look at rpm package management. It is 
a python module and a collection of scripts that provide similar functionality
as rpm, yum and co. It is written from ground up and is implemented only in
python. It mainly deals with rpm packages, the rpm database `rpmdb` in 
`/var/lib/rpm`, comps.xml files and yum repositories (called repo data).
